Implemented a neural network from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, including custom implementations of forward propagation, backpropagation, weight updates, and activation functions without high-level ML libraries.

Preprocessed and normalized image data from CSV format, split into training and development sets, and applied one-hot encoding to labels for multi-class classification.

Achieved accurate digit classification by optimizing model parameters via gradient descent and evaluated performance with custom accuracy metrics and visualization of predictions using Matplotlib.
